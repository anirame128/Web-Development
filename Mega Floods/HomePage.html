    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">The Mystery of Mega Floods</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"></p>

    		<p class="w3-justify">Mega floods have taken place all around the globe.
    They have used their powerful force to shape the landscapes we see today.
    Although not about them is known sientist are using new ways to find out how these dramatic landscapes formed.
 	</p>
		<p>Mega floods have taken place all around the globe.
They have used their powerful force to shape the landscapes we see today.
Although very much of their stories are overlooked.
Mega floods are mostly created by glacial lakes held by crippeling dams.
When the water is let out it flows at a rapid pace.
There are a many places were this same process has happened.
</p>
		<p>The scablands, one of the many extraordinary landscapes that have been changed by the violent forces of a mega flood.
The scablands formation puzzled scientists for many years.
The dramatic cliffs and mountains were then found out to have been the result of a mega flood.
While researching scientists found one clue that brought them to the idea of a flood.
Most cliffs that have been carved or eroded by water will have the shape of a horseshoe.
One of the most known waterfalls in the world niagara falls has the same shape as cliffs in the scablands.
For that reason this part of the scablands is called the dry falls. They are five times the size of niagara and almost twice as tall.
</p>
		<p>Another clue also lies here in the scablands.
Many miles away from the drie falls are strange super sized sinkholes.
Sinkholes are many times found under fast going rivers.
This can only point to one thing that a giant force of water carved this ripped apart landscape.
Something very mysterious is that there is not a single lake or river the size and proximity away from this area to suit a flood like this.
To get this type of formation a huge amount of water must be in the area.
</p>
		<p>To  answer this peculiar question scientists investigate a different landscape three and a half thousand miles away in Iceland.
This island is a place of fire and ice. In the northeast corner huge scars similar to those of the scablands are found.
This is the Asbyrgi canyon. Like in the scablands scientists want to know how this similar landscape was created.
They are so similar that people suspect they were made in the same way.
To find out how long it took to carve these magnificent landscapes scientists are using a method called surface exposure dating.
Earths surface rocks are constantly bombarded by cosmic rays from space.
Cosmic rays are proton particles continuously entering the Earths atmosphere at incredible rates.
When a proton collides with an atom in the Earths atmosphere, it can break apart that atom to produce elements in the form of neutrons, protons, and other  particles.
Those particles continue traveling toward the Earths surface, likely colliding with additional atoms on the way.
</p>
		<p>When entering the Earths surface, these particles quickly collide with the atoms around it, breaking apart more atoms in the upper 2 meters of a rock.
Some elements are only produced by interaction with radiation.
By measuring the amount of these elements you this now allows you to determine how long it has been exposed to the suns radiation.
</p>
			<p>When scientists used this method they found amazing results.
It said that all the rock in the area was unearthed or eroded at the same time and that it happened 9,000 years ago.
Scientist then thought of the idea that it was a titanic flood. A flood much bigger than the ones we see today.
It seems as if this could impossible but water can do much more damage than you think.
A flood only 6 inches can make people fall in a second.
Although is it possible to create a flood big enough to carve solid bedrock?
Scientists have found a new theory that suggests huge amounts of water released by the heat of volcanoes.
Scientist have found a huge number of volcanoes in iceland. This has evan happened before.
Evan around the scablands is a chain of volcanoes including the destructive Mount St. Helens.
Although there is one problem. Evan if all the ice on Mount St. Helens suddenly melted it still would not be enough to destroy 16,000 cubic miles of rock.
</p>
			<p>Scientists then figured out that the scablands were formed 16,000 years ago.
This was during the last ice age when most of North America was covered with ice and scientists believed that the ice sheets stop in front of the volcano belt.
Only after a while did scientists make the greatest discovery yet involving the mega food mystery.
200 miles away from the scab land in Missoula Montana scientist find something amazing.
While climbing the hills bordering the city scientist see lines in the rock resembling a shoreline.
People think that a huge glacial lake once covered the city of Missoula, but where has it gone.
If there was a lake here the mass would have been big enough to support the flood that carved the scablands.
The valley is now open ended so no water could have been held here unless a dam of some sort held the water in place.
</p>
			<p>Travelling down the mountain scientists spot a clue in the rock.
The rock has been smoothed of a scratch.This can only happen with glacial ice.
Now we know that there once was an ice sheet that blocked the open end of the hills and created lake Missoula.
For the formation of the scablands to happen all of this water had to have been released at one point in time as a catastrophic flood.
The only way a dam of this size could give away in a matter of minutes. The water had to have eroded the dam from the bottom and caused it to collapse.
It released 500 cubic miles of water, destroyed the landscape and carried it to the pacific ocean.
Although the core samples taken from the pacific tell a different story.
They say that a multiple floods caused this to happen.
The only explanation to this is that the ice dam would have collapsed and then rebuilt itself multiple times.
Causing multiple floods to pummel the landscape.
</p>
			<p>Finally after years and years of clues and research scientist have uncovered the mystery of mega floods but what else could these disasters floods create?

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">The stories behind the disasters</h2>
	<p>	Two of the most devastating mega floods are the English Channel flood and the Texas mega flood.
The floods literally tore the landscape they were in.
The marks and scars are there to prove it but what really happened those days?
</p>
	<p>The mystery of the Texas mega flood started when a huge storm hit central Texas.
Canyon lake reservoir flooded a huge part of the area.
The water tore through the area, every 2 second enough water to fill an olympic swimming pool poured over.
When the water subsided, a huge scar and mark was left onto the bedrock.
The gorge was 23 feet deep and over a mile long. This was scientific proof.
It showed that Mega Floods could still happen.
It also proved that a flood could still happen on a huge scale.
This means that one day or another a flood this devastating and powerful could rip apart what we see today.

</p>
	<p>The mystery of the english channel started when scientists researched the white cliffs of Dover.
While doing research they made an amazing discovery. Buried inside the cliffs were things called bands of flint.
These bands of flint going up and down the cliffs form a geological fingerprint into the cliffs.
These geological fingerprints are one of a kind and they go through the whole cliff.
The surprising thing is that both sides of the English Channel have the same geological fingerprint.
This allows scientists to draw the conclusion that a huge mass of land once connected england to france.
Scientists are puzzled mainly because they have yet to see a disaster with the power to rip apart the land bridge between France and England.
</p>
	<p>To find the answer to this mystery scientists scan the channels floor and they find something amazing.
Deep at the channels bottom lays mountains and hills of rock carved by a violent force. A mega flood.
Scientists now believe that a natural dam of chalk formed that held in melted water from the ice sheet over russia.
When the dam broke it released almost half of its water. The land bridge was broken a now filled with water.
